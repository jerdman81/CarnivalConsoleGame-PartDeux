# CarnivalConsoleGame-PartDeux

The CarnivalConsoleGame started as a pair programming project in the Gold Badge module of the ElevenFiftyAcademy Software Development boot camp.

The code in the original [CarnivalConsoleGame](http://github.com/jerdman81/CarnivalConsoleGame) is what was submitted for grading on that project.

This repository represents further development of the game as a solo project.

##  Gameplay

The character represents a kid who has been dropped off at the county fair midway with 200 tickets and 2 hours until pickup time.  The goal is to have as much fun as possible in those two hours by earning "Fun Points".

The midway layout is a circle with the Ticket Booth in the middle.  Four of the games have paths directly to the ticket booth.  Use these paths as shortcuts to other games and rides.

Guide your character through the game by typing commands starting with GO, RIDE, or PLAY depending on the context.  Time is always ticking away and each action takes time and tickets but also adds Fun Points.

The game ends when the player runs out of time.

Type EXIT at any time to quit the game.


### Development Ideas

- ~~Add functionality for time deduction on GO actions.~~
- Optimize time/tickets to make game more playable.
- Implement money variable.  Earn money from games. Exchange money for tickets at Ticket Booth.
- Introduce random chance to determine game winnings.
- Introduce random chance actions that can help or hurt player
- Implement ASCII art
- Implement colorful interface to make game more visually appealing.
