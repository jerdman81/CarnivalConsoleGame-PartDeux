# CarnivalConsoleGame-PartDeux

The CarnivalConsoleGame started as a pair programming project in the Gold Badge module of the ElevenFiftyAcademy Software Development boot camp.

The code in the original [CarnivalConsoleGame](http://github.com/jerdman81/CarnivalConsoleGame) is what was submitted for grading on that project.

This repository represents further development of the game as a solo project.

Some further ideas for development include:
- ~~Add functionality for time deduction on GO actions.~~
- Optimize time/tickets to make game more playable.
- Implement money variable.  Earn money from games. Exchange money for tickets at Ticket Booth.
- Introduce random chance to determine game winnings.
- Introduce random chance actions that can help or hurt player
- ???
